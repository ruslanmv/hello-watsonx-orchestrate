## üöÄ **From Zero to Hero: Building a Multi-Agent System with Watsonx Orchestrat**

### **Introduction**

Welcome to the world of AI agents\! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a **multi-agent system**. Instead of a single, monolithic AI, we will create a team of specialized agents that collaborate to solve problems. Our system will have:

  * **Greeting Agent**: A specialist for handling greetings.
  * **Echo Agent**: A simple agent that repeats any general message.
  * **Calculator Agent**: A powerful agent that can perform math using a Python tool.
  * **Orchestrator Agent**: The "manager" agent that receives all user requests and decides which specialist should handle the task.

This "manager-worker" pattern is fundamental to creating sophisticated and reliable AI systems. Let's get started\!

### **‚úÖ Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1.  **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python and `pip` are installed and accessible from your command line.
2.  **Docker**: The ADK development server runs in a Docker container, so you must have Docker Desktop or another container environment (like Colima) installed and running.
3.  **IBM Cloud Account (Optional)**: While the local server runs with offline "stub" models, connecting to `watsonx.ai` gives you access to powerful LLMs like Llama 3. If you choose to connect, you'll need a project and an API key.

-----

### **üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Project Setup**

To make things easier, all the code for this tutorial is ready for you. Let's clone the repository and set up a clean Python environment.

1.  **Clone the Project Files**
    Open your terminal and run the following command to download all the necessary YAML and Python files.

    ```bash
    # This is a placeholder URL for the example.
    git clone https://github.com/example/hello-watsonx-agents.git
    cd hello-watsonx-agents
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    A virtual environment keeps your project's dependencies isolated.

    *On macOS / Linux:*

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    *On Windows (Command Prompt):*

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

### **‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Install and Configure the ADK**

Now, we'll install the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agent Developer Kit (ADK) and start the local development server.

1.  **Install the ADK**
    Use `pip` to install the core `orchestrate` library.

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
    ```

2.  **Activate and Start the Local Server**
    The ADK's local server runs in Docker and provides an offline environment for development.

    ```bash
    # Point the CLI to your local environment
    orchestrate env activate local

    # Start the server and accept the license
    orchestrate server start --accept-license
    ```

    **Important**: Keep this terminal window open\! The server must be running for your agents to work. If you accidentally close it, simply run the `orchestrate server start --accept-license` command again in a new terminal.

-----

### **ü§ñ Step 3: Create and Validate Your Agents**

The project you cloned contains all the agent definitions. Let's review them and learn how to validate them before use.

A best practice is to run `orchestrate validate -f <your-file.yaml>` before importing anything. This command checks for typos, incorrect model IDs, and other common errors.

#### **Agent 1: The Greeting Agent (`greeting_agent.yaml`)**

This agent's only job is to respond to greetings. Note the instructions are written to be case-insensitive.

```yaml
# greeting_agent.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: greeting_agent
description: A friendly agent that handles greetings.
llm: watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct
instructions: |
  If the user's message contains the word "hello" (case-insensitive), you MUST respond with: "Hello! I am the Greeting Agent."
tools: []
```

*Validate it:* `orchestrate validate -f greeting_agent.yaml`

#### **Agent 2: The Echo Agent (`echo_agent.yaml`)**

This agent echoes any input back, using the correct `{input}` placeholder for the user's message.

```yaml
# echo_agent.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: echo_agent
description: An agent that echoes back the user's message.
llm: watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct
instructions: |
  Your task is to repeat the user's exact input back to them.
  You MUST respond with the format: "The Echo Agent heard you say: {input}"
tools: []
```

*Validate it:* `orchestrate validate -f echo_agent.yaml`

#### **The Collaborator Pattern**

The Orchestrator Agent will manage our other agents. It uses the `collaborators` keyword to gain access to them. The message flow looks like this:

```ascii
     User Input
          ‚îÇ
          ‚ñº
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ Orchestrator Agent ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
          ‚îÇ
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∫ If "hello" is in message... ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
          ‚îÇ                                  ‚îÇ Greeting Agent ‚îÇ
          ‚îÇ                                  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
          ‚îÇ
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∫ If message is math... ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
          ‚îÇ                                  ‚îÇ Calculator Agent ‚îÇ
          ‚îÇ                                  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
          ‚îÇ
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Otherwise... ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
                                             ‚îÇ  Echo Agent  ‚îÇ
                                             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

#### **Agent 3: The Orchestrator Agent (`orchestrator_agent.yaml`)**

This is the brain of our system. It contains the routing logic to delegate tasks to the correct specialist.

```yaml
# orchestrator_agent.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: orchestrator_agent
description: The main agent that routes tasks to the correct collaborator.
llm: watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct
collaborators:
  - greeting_agent
  - echo_agent
  - calculator_agent
instructions: |
  You are a router. Your job is to delegate tasks to the appropriate agent based on these rules:
  - If the user's message contains the word "hello" (case-insensitive), delegate to the `greeting_agent`.
  - If the user's message involves math, calculation, or adding numbers, delegate to the `calculator_agent`.
  - For ALL other inputs, delegate to the `echo_agent`.
  Do not answer directly. Only delegate.
tools: []
```

*Validate it:* `orchestrate validate -f orchestrator_agent.yaml` (This will fail for now, as it doesn't know about `calculator_agent` yet. We'll fix that next\!)

-----

### **ü¶∏ Step 4: The "Hero" Leap - Empowering Agents with Python Tools**

Agents that only talk are useful, but agents that *do things* are powerful. Here‚Äôs how we create our `calculator_agent`. **Order is critical**: we must create and import the tool *before* the agent that uses it.

#### **4.1: Create the Python Tool (`calculator_tool.py`)**

The ADK requires the `@tool` decorator to discover and register a Python function.

```python
# calculator_tool.py
from orchestrate_sdk import tool
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import Field

@tool(name="add", description="A tool to add two numbers.")
def add(a: Annotated[int, Field(description="The first number to add")],
        b: Annotated[int, Field(description="The second number to add")]) -> str:
  """
  Adds two numbers together and returns the result as a string.
  Use this tool for any addition calculation.
  """
  result = a + b
  return f"The result of {a} + {b} is {result}."
```

#### **4.2: Create the Calculator Agent (`calculator_agent.yaml`)**

This agent is explicitly designed to use our new `add` tool.

```yaml
# calculator_agent.yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: calculator_agent
description: An agent that can perform addition.
llm: watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct
instructions: |
  You are a calculator. When asked to add numbers, you MUST use the `add` tool.
tools:
  - add
```

*Validate it:* `orchestrate validate -f calculator_agent.yaml`

-----

### **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 5: Import and Test Your Multi-Agent System**

With all our files defined and validated, let's import them into Orchestrate and start chatting.

1.  **Open a NEW terminal window** (leave the server running) and activate your virtual environment.

2.  **Import the Tool First**
    Tools must exist before the agents that rely on them.

    ```bash
    orchestrate tools import -k python -f calculator_tool.py
    ```

3.  **Import the Agents**
    Now import all the agents.

    ```bash
    orchestrate agents import -f greeting_agent.yaml
    orchestrate agents import -f echo_agent.yaml
    orchestrate agents import -f calculator_agent.yaml
    orchestrate agents import -f orchestrator_agent.yaml
    ```

4.  **Start the Chat\!**
    This command launches the chat UI. We point it to our `orchestrator_agent`, which will be the entry point. Note the plural `--agents` flag.

    ```bash
    orchestrate chat start --agents orchestrator_agent
    ```

#### **Testing Scenarios**

Open the chat URL provided in your terminal and try these prompts:

  * **Input:** `hello there`

      * **Expected Output:** `Hello! I am the Greeting Agent.`
      * **Why?** The orchestrator detected "hello" and delegated to the `greeting_agent`.

  * **Input:** `what is 11 plus 54?`

      * **Expected Output:** `The result of 11 + 54 is 65.`
      * **Why?** The orchestrator detected a math query and delegated to the `calculator_agent`, which then executed the Python `add` tool.

  * **Input:** `This is a test.`

      * **Expected Output:** `The Echo Agent heard you say: This is a test.`
      * **Why?** The input didn't match the rules for greeting or math, so the orchestrator used its fallback rule and delegated to the `echo_agent`.

**Congratulations\!** You have successfully built and tested a smart, tool-enabled multi-agent system. üéâ

-----

### **üßπ Step 6: Cleaning Up Your Environment**

When you're finished, you can remove the assets you've created and stop the server.

```bash
# Delete the agents
orchestrate agents delete orchestrator_agent
orchestrate agents delete calculator_agent
orchestrate agents delete greeting_agent
orchestrate agents delete echo_agent

# Delete the tool
orchestrate tools delete add

# Stop the local development server (from the server's terminal)
# Press Ctrl+C, then run:
orchestrate server stop
```

### **ü§î Troubleshooting Cheat-Sheet**

| Error Message | Common Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Error: no such option: --api-key` | Using an old, invalid flag with `orchestrate server start`. | Use `orchestrate server start --accept-license` instead. |
| `Error: Agent 'X' not found` | The agent was not imported, or its name is misspelled in a `collaborators` list. | Ensure all agents are imported successfully before starting the chat. Check for typos. |
| `Error: Tool 'Y' for agent 'X' not found` | The agent was imported before its tool, or the tool import failed. | Always import tools *before* the agents that use them. |
| `Address already in use` or `Port is already allocated` | The ADK server (or another process) is already running and using port 8080 or 8443. | Stop the existing server with `orchestrate server stop` before starting a new one. |

### **üéì Next Steps & Best Practices**

You've mastered the basics\! Now you're ready to become a true hero.

  * **Explore Knowledge Bases**: Teach agents by giving them documents to read. They can answer questions based on PDFs, Word docs, and more.
  * **Build with Flow Builder**: For complex, multi-step tasks, use the Flow Builder to chain tools and logic together in a visual way.
  * **Write Unit Tests**: The ADK includes a Python SDK that lets you write tests for your agents' behavior, perfect for CI/CD pipelines.
  * **Read the Docs**: For a deep dive into all features, check out the **[Official watsonx Orchestrate ADK Documentation](https://ibm.biz/wxo-adk-docs)**.
